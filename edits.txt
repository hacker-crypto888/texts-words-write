Extra features:
- [ ] to display each audio in a carousel and remove slide of carousel once word is written correctly
- [ ] the program modifies the word according to its termination, therefore it can find the word in the database of sounds (in the mp3 file list in all the keys of key value pairs, all the keys are all the words of the database)

## Database files

        Words from text of the day

- Text -> file

- Open file with text -> split into word list

Save the words in DB
    
- Open big database with "id", "word", and "date" columns

- update = Append new words to the database

Start the app

- Write a simple JSON file with columns "id" and "word" and start the app

        Selection of words in the database using date of data entry

- Open big database

- Save words matching the specified date of data entry in a JSON file with "id" and "word" columns, then start the app

- remove last word = remove this text

- the database json must be a text list, not a word list
- if the database json contains only text how not to erase one text that has same id as other text
- the following meassure can be taken: look for similar words in my content field
- the "edit entries" window should return a message "no items found" when no items has been loaded
- the "log in" and "import words from json" (actually import database function) buttons should both remove the texts that were not previously used in the program by the connected user
- the entries editor should display the text informations in a table not in a single line
- the words that could not be recognized by the audio displayer should be listed
- the date and other info (the user list) could be updated only once the user made some modification in the entries editor, so the entries editor could also be only available when the user is connected. (differences between the connected user and guest user)
